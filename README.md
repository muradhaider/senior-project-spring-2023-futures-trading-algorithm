#Project Description
The Futures Trading Algorithm is a computer program designed to help traders trade futures markets more effectively. The algorithm uses technical analysis to identify trends and market conditions, and automatically executes trades based on these signals. The system is based on an object-oriented design and is built on top of the NinjaTrader 8 platform.
The algorithm relies on a combination of EMA and VMA crosses, along with stochastic conditions, to filter out chop and catch high-frequency trends. To reduce the number of trades taken in choppy markets, the algorithm also uses specific candle types and dynamically adjusts the indicators based on market conditions. The trading strategy is designed to run in real-time using historical market data, and can be used with a prop firm account.
Overall, the Futures Trading Algorithm provides traders with a powerful tool for automating their trading strategy and taking advantage of opportunities in the futures market.

How to run the Futures Trading Algorithm
Launch the Rithmic platform and sign in using the credentials provided by the prop firm.
Launch NinjaTrader and connect it to the Rithmic platform using the same credentials.
Import the trading strategy by going to the Import tab and selecting the appropriate file.
Open the chart you wish to apply the strategy to.
Select the Strategies button and enable the strategy you want to apply.
The algorithm will automatically apply the trading signals to the market data and execute trades based on the predetermined entry and exit conditions.
